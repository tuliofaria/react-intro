# Hello ReactJS!

---

# What is ReactJS?

ReactJS is an UI library.

It works describing the UI structure in **memory**.

also defines some ways of changing this representation in memory.

---

# Let's describe an UI

But just another concept: React abstracts parts of the UI into components.

A component is a function that returns a React element.

---

```jsx
import React from 'react'

const MyComponent = (props) => {
  // this is JSX ðŸ‘‡
  return (
    <div>
      <h1 className='my-title'>Hello U.org</h1>
    </div>
  )
}

export default MyComponent
```

---

# JSX - Javascript Extension

JSX is not HTML. Babel will convert/compile it to React elements with `React.createElement`

---

This is the final output from previous component.

```
import React from 'react'

const MyComponent = props => {

  return React.createElement(
    "div",
    {},
    React.createElement(
      "h1",
      {
        className: "my-title"
      },
      "Hello U.org"
    )
  );
}
```

---

<Split>

```jsx
import React from 'react'

const MyComponent = (props) => {
  // this is JSX ðŸ‘‡
  return (
    <div>
      <h1 className='my-title'>Hello U.org</h1>
    </div>
  )
}
```

```
import React from 'react'

const MyComponent = props => {

  return React.createElement(
    "div",
    {},
    React.createElement(
      "h1",
      {
        className: "my-title"
      },
      "Hello U.org"
    )
  );
}
```

Note that this is an expression.

```jsx
import React from 'react'

const sayHello = (name) => 'Hello ' + name

const MyComponent = (props) => {
  // this is JSX ðŸ‘‡
  return (
    <div>
      <h1 className='my-title'>{sayHello('U.org')}</h1>
    </div>
  )
}
```

---

```
import React from 'react'

const sayHello = (name) => 'Hello ' + name

const MyComponent = props => {

  return React.createElement(
    "div",
    {},
    React.createElement(
      "h1",
      {
        className: "my-title"
      },
      sayHello("U.org")
    )
  );
}

# So the UI is stored in memory

How to see something on screen?

Meet: `react-dom` (`react-native`, `react-vr`, ...)

---

# How does this work?

- `react` represents the UI
- `react-dom` reads this and reproduce it into real-DOM (the browser's DOM)
- this process is know as **reconcilliation**
- this process happens everytime the UI represented by `react` changes

---

# Pratical example:

## With React.createElement

## Reconcilliation

---

# How to update an UI?

Introducing `hooks` and `props`
(practice)

---

# But React and React-dom

Is a single page application (SPA)
(a HTML file including a Javascript bundle)

The main problem: this is not good for SEO and indexing.

So pure `react` + `react-dom` is not indexed by search engines.

---

# NextJS

NextJS is a fullstack web framework.

Besides other things it renders the initial reconcilliation at the server and send it to the browser.
